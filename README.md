# Mini-codes
Small Python projects designed to practice fundamental coding concepts of Python. Includes projects like dice game, number guessing, rock-paper-scissors, and more


## The key concepts in these codes are:

**1.Loops:** Used to repeatedly ask the user for input (e.g., while and for loops). 

**2.Conditionals:** if, elif, and else statements to handle logic (e.g., determining the winner or validating input). 

**3.User Input:** input() to get user choices and .lower() to make input case-insensitive. 

**4.Module:** the random module provides functions for generating random numbers or random choice. Here,random.randint() and random.choice() for generating random dice rolls and computer moves. 

**5.Error Handling:** Gracefully handling invalid inputs (e.g., using try/except
